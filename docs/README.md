# README Paths, aka "Where to Put Your Fat README files" in a nutshell
Ever thought, README.md files are very annoying? Well this is your *"saving grace"*!

Links to our other repositories/*"so-called organisations"*!
|REPOs/Guides!|Organisations!|
|-------------|------------|
|What a big fat oofie!|We have some!|
|We're **EMPTY**!|But we're not finished configuring them.|
|*Hey! That rhymes!* :D|What a bummer! :P|


### Let's get started!
### So, you may think, where is the file, the README file I'm looking at? I don't see it. Also where is the license?
(We don't have a license, the [license file](/docs/LICENSE.txt) is ***FAKE***.)
##### Where is the license file?
Huh, I don't know, hmm, can I ask you back? "Where ***IS*** the [license file](/docs), huh?
### Where is the README file I'm reading right now?
[idk, I *ABOSOLUTELY 100%LY DONT KNOW WHERE IS IT*. ](/docs)<sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sup><sup>i am struggling lieing xD</sup></sup></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub> **I DEFENITLY *DON'T* KNOW!**
##### .github?
Yes, you can put those in .github, butt although your visitor can see the README/license files, we can't put the files in there, ***WHY?*** because, the folder is *hidden* from non-colaborators.

### Sooo, yeah! Here is a random tables to clarify! <sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sup><sup>*The sarcasm lol*</sup></sup></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub> :D
